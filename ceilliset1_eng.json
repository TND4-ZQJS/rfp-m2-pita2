High partial withdrawals may cause the future account value to be insufficient to cover the higher cost of insurance at older ages. Therefore, it is prudent for a policy owner to make ad hoc top-ups to replenish the units and the account value\nIII. Depending on the practices instituted by individual life insurers, all fund switches may be processed free of charge, or be free for the first switch or first few switches within a policy year and a fee is charged for subsequent switches\nIV.
